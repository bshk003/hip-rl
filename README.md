### Deep-Q network for the game of Hip
This is a ML/reinforcement learning project. The goal was to explore how the DQN approach can be used to build an AI bot for playing the game known as *Hip*.

The game of Hip, introduced by Martin Gardner back in 1957, is a board game for two players. The board is a rectangular grid, originally of dimensions 6-by-6. The players take turns marking a single cell red, for player 1, or blue, for player 2. A player loses if a square with vertices of their respective color appears on the board. A square can be tilted.
